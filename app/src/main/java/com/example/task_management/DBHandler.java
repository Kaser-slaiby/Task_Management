     * populate the new table with the contents of the old table.

     * <em>Important:</em> You should NOT modify an existing migration step from version X to X+1
     * once a build has been released containing that migration step.  If a migration step has an
     * error and it runs on a device, the step will NOT re-run itself in the future if a fix is made
     * to the migration step.</p>
     * <p>For example, suppose a migration step renames a database column from {@code foo} to
     * {@code bar} when the name should have been {@code baz}.  If that migration step is released
     * in a build and runs on a user's device, the column will be renamed to {@code bar}.  If the
     * developer subsequently edits this same migration step to change the name to {@code baz} as
     * intended, the user devices which have already run this step will still have the name
     * {@code bar}.  Instead, a NEW migration step should be created to correct the error and rename
     * {@code bar} to {@code baz}, ensuring the error is corrected on devices which have already run
     * the migration step with the error.</p>
